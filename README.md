## How it works

1. **Block types** (Text block & Image block) are on the right sidebar; We add blocks to the landing page preview using these buttons;
2. **The Text block** is editable directly on the Landing page preview by clicking on the text itself;
3. When adding an **Image block** to the Landing page preview, we first need to choose from the predefined images;
4. The **Image block** is editable by right-clicking on the image itself and choosing the image we want to replace it with;
5. By **dragging and dropping** we can **reorder** the blocks on the landing page;
6. On hover on each block two buttons show up for each block separately which are used to **Duplicate or Delete** the block;
7. The **Save** button prints the current Landing page structure on the console;
